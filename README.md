Okay I'm really lazy and I can't be arsed to copy all my code out individually, so if you're stuck with anything throughout the year, you SHOULD be able to find it here, do some digging or just ask me

You can also find the other stuff I've been working on

Enjoy yourself товарищ

# Where to find stuff

The stuff where we had to work through the PDF (which obviously says is the OCR Course) is in the, believe it or not, "OCRCourse" folder. The code for that can be found in "OCRCourse.py", unbelievable, I know.

I've made a simple system on mine so you can choose the example you want to run, so for instance if you're looking for 13a, it should be under 
```python
elif example == "3a":'
```
and before the next question, which will once again be another
```python
elif example
```
